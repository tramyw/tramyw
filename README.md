# Hi there 👋

## 🧑🏻‍💻 This is Tramy

🔥 Diving deep into **front-end development**, I specialize in crafting **eye-catching, user-friendly websites**. I stay ahead with the latest design trends and technologies to create innovative solutions that push the boundaries of **design** and **user experience**. 🚀

🌟 Eager to collaborate on groundbreaking projects that challenge the norm, I aim to make front-end solutions more impactful and accessible. My fascination with Midjourney, a cutting-edge **generative AI**, fuels my exploration of its potential applications. 🤖

💡 Curious about my journey from **graphic design** to front-end web development? When I'm not coding, you'll find me whipping up new recipes in the kitchen or savoring a delicious cup of coffee. ☕️
